""" When you Fourier Transform an Image most of the fourier coefficients are quite small and
    can be truncated or thresholded away so we can zero out all of the small fourier coefficients
    retaining only the largest 1% or 2% of those FFT values and then

    When we inverse Fourier Transform that thresholded FFT signal we recover the original image
    with relatively low degradation

    So compression comes about by only saving these largest %1 or %2 fourier coefficients """
